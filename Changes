Revision history for Perl extension Directory::Scanner

0.03
    - major re-arrangement of the internals for building
      a stream, there is no longer an endpoint called
      `stream` which you must call before things are
      usable, instead things are just always usable.
    - removed the `stream` method from `Directory::Scanner`
    - moved all the builder methods from `Directory::Scanner`
      to `Directory::Scanner::API::Stream` instead, so that
      you can always wrap/mutate your stream if you like.
